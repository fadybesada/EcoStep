                  Agricultural corporations greenhouse gas emissions are actually worse than fossil fuels. Our focus on diminishing our dependence on fossil fuels blinds us from a greater culprit.

                <p>All electronic devices still use energy while in standby. Standby is responsible for draining $19 billion worth of energy a year. Keep your device(s) unplugged at all times if your not using them.</p>
